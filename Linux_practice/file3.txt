This is line one in my text file
I am practicing Git Bash commands
Git is a version control system
Bash allows command line interaction
Files can be created using editors
Nano is a simple text editor
Vim is another popular editor
Git tracks file changes
Commits help save progress
Repositories store project history
Branches allow parallel work
Merging combines changes
Conflicts must be resolved carefully
Pull fetches updates from remote
Push sends changes to remote
